# Youtube_Data_Analysis
In this project, I utilized the YouTube Data API to retrieve frontend data, including view counts, comments, and video length, among other factors. 
By leveraging data from the YouTube API, we can gain valuable insights into the strategies employed by competitive YouTubers to manage their channels. 
For instance, we can analyze their frequency of audience interaction and identify the most common video topics on their channels.
